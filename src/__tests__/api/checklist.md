## Usage Instructions
1. Copy this checklist for each API endpoint
2. Mark items as completed when tests are implemented
3. Add any endpoint-specific items
4. Review and update regularly
5. Use as a guide for code reviews
6. Share with team members

## Notes
- Some items may not apply to all endpoints
- Add endpoint-specific requirements
- Update checklist as new requirements emerge
- Consider automated testing where possible
- Regular security audits are recommended
