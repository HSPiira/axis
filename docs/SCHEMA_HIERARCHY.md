## Notes
- Each phase should be implemented sequentially to ensure proper dependency management
- Testing should be performed at each phase before moving to the next
- API documentation should be updated as each phase is completed
- Security measures should be implemented at each phase
- Performance monitoring should be set up from the beginning
